## Accumulated Context

### Decisions

Decisions are logged in PROJECT.md Key Decisions table.
Recent decisions affecting current work:

- [Roadmap]: 7-phase build order following component dependency graph (Foundation -> Ingress -> Extraction -> LLM -> Notion -> Integration -> Deployment)
- [Roadmap]: Phase 1 is scaffolding with no v1 requirements -- establishes models and config that Phases 2-7 import
- [Phase 01]: Used uv_build as build backend (generated by uv init --package)
- [Phase 01]: ContentType enum values use display-friendly strings matching Notion property values
- [Phase 01]: Config fields default to empty strings for API keys to avoid import-time crashes

### Pending Todos

None yet.

### Blockers/Concerns

- [Research]: Gemini 3 Flash Preview structured output API specifics need verification before Phase 4 (LOW confidence on exact syntax)
- [Research]: youtube-transcript-api current status should be verified before Phase 3 (check GitHub issues for recent breakage)
- [Research]: Cloud Run "always allocated" flag name needs verification before Phase 7
- [Research]: All package versions from training data -- must verify against PyPI before writing requirements.txt
