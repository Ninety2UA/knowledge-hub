# Project State

## Project Reference

See: .planning/PROJECT.md (updated 2026-02-19)

**Core value:** Every link shared in Slack becomes a structured, searchable, actionable Notion entry -- automatically, reliably, within 60 seconds.
**Current focus:** Phase 5 complete -- Notion Output with page creation service and 38 tests. Ready for Phase 6.

## Current Position

Phase: 5 of 7 (Notion Output) -- COMPLETE
Plan: 2 of 2 in current phase (05-02 complete)
Status: Phase 5 complete -- ready for Phase 6
Last activity: 2026-02-21 -- Completed 05-02-PLAN.md (Page creation service + test suite)

Progress: [████████░░] 71%

## Performance Metrics

**Velocity:**
- Total plans completed: 10
- Average duration: 3.1min

## Accumulated Context

### Decisions

Decisions are logged in PROJECT.md Key Decisions table.
Recent decisions affecting current work:

- [Roadmap]: 7-phase build order following component dependency graph (Foundation -> Ingress -> Extraction -> LLM -> Notion -> Integration -> Deployment)
- [Roadmap]: Phase 1 is scaffolding with no v1 requirements -- establishes models and config that Phases 2-7 import
- [Phase 01]: Used uv_build as build backend (generated by uv init --package)
- [Phase 01]: ContentType enum values use display-friendly strings matching Notion property values
- [Phase 01]: Config fields default to empty strings for API keys to avoid import-time crashes
- [Phase 01]: Plain def tests (not async) since TestClient handles async internally
- [Phase 01]: Session-scoped TestClient fixture to avoid re-creating ASGI app per test
- [Phase 01]: Docker build verification deferred -- Docker not installed on dev machine
- [Phase 02]: GET for redirect resolution instead of HEAD (some shorteners reject HEAD)
- [Phase 02]: Retry dedup at router level via X-Slack-Retry-Num header
- [Phase 02]: Background task creates per-URL SlackEvent for Phase 3+ handoff
- [Phase 02]: Sync tests for pure functions, async for httpx-dependent functions
- [Phase 02]: HMAC signing helper in test_router.py (not conftest) -- scoped to router tests only
- [Phase 02]: unittest.mock.patch over FastAPI dependency override for simpler unit test isolation
- [Phase 03]: Paywalled domains YAML stored in extraction/ package (not config/) to avoid shadowing config.py
- [Phase 03]: PyYAML used via trafilatura transitive dependency
- [Phase 03]: 200-word threshold for paywall partial detection on known paywalled domains
- [Phase 03]: extract_content is an alias for extract_with_timeout -- clean public API name
- [Phase 03]: Transient errors (httpx, connection, OS) get one retry; permanent YouTube errors not retried
- [Phase 03]: 3-second minimum remaining budget threshold before attempting retry
- [Phase 04]: LLMResponse contains only LLM-generated fields -- source/date/status/content_type from extraction metadata
- [Phase 04]: No HttpRetryOptions on Gemini client -- tenacity handles retries to avoid double-retry
- [Phase 04]: Short content addendum for ANY content type under 500 words
- [Phase 04]: 58 seeded tags as module constant for easy maintenance
- [Phase 04]: GEMINI_MODEL as constant not config for preview model management
- [Phase 04]: ValidationError from Gemini response logged and re-raised for caller to handle
- [Phase 04]: Priority override applied to LLMResponse before build_notion_page to keep mapping pure
- [Phase 05]: Manual utm_* stripping before url_normalize -- filter_params=True removes ALL params
- [Phase 05]: Duplicated _split_rich_text in properties.py and blocks.py for module self-containment
- [Phase 05]: Bold via Notion rich_text annotations, not markdown syntax (renders as literal asterisks)
- [Phase 05]: url_normalize preserves protocol and trailing slashes (RFC normalization only) -- tests match actual behavior

### Pending Todos

None yet.

### Blockers/Concerns

- [Research]: Gemini 3 Flash Preview structured output API -- google-genai v1.64.0 installed and imports verified (Phase 4 Plan 01)
- [Research]: youtube-transcript-api verified working (v1.2.4 installed) -- instance fetch() method confirmed
- [Research]: Cloud Run "always allocated" flag name needs verification before Phase 7
- [Research]: All package versions from training data -- must verify against PyPI before writing requirements.txt
- [Phase 01]: Docker not installed on dev machine -- Dockerfile created but build/run verification deferred to Phase 7
