## Accumulated Context

### Decisions

Decisions are logged in PROJECT.md Key Decisions table.
Recent decisions affecting current work:

- [Roadmap]: 7-phase build order following component dependency graph (Foundation -> Ingress -> Extraction -> LLM -> Notion -> Integration -> Deployment)
- [Roadmap]: Phase 1 is scaffolding with no v1 requirements -- establishes models and config that Phases 2-7 import
- [Phase 01]: Used uv_build as build backend (generated by uv init --package)
- [Phase 01]: ContentType enum values use display-friendly strings matching Notion property values
- [Phase 01]: Config fields default to empty strings for API keys to avoid import-time crashes
- [Phase 01]: Plain def tests (not async) since TestClient handles async internally
- [Phase 01]: Session-scoped TestClient fixture to avoid re-creating ASGI app per test
- [Phase 01]: Docker build verification deferred -- Docker not installed on dev machine
- [Phase 02]: GET for redirect resolution instead of HEAD (some shorteners reject HEAD)
- [Phase 02]: Retry dedup at router level via X-Slack-Retry-Num header
- [Phase 02]: Background task creates per-URL SlackEvent for Phase 3+ handoff
- [Phase 02]: Sync tests for pure functions, async for httpx-dependent functions
- [Phase 02]: HMAC signing helper in test_router.py (not conftest) -- scoped to router tests only
- [Phase 02]: unittest.mock.patch over FastAPI dependency override for simpler unit test isolation
- [Phase 03]: Paywalled domains YAML stored in extraction/ package (not config/) to avoid shadowing config.py
- [Phase 03]: PyYAML used via trafilatura transitive dependency
- [Phase 03]: 200-word threshold for paywall partial detection on known paywalled domains

### Pending Todos

None yet.

### Blockers/Concerns

- [Research]: Gemini 3 Flash Preview structured output API specifics need verification before Phase 4 (LOW confidence on exact syntax)
- [Research]: youtube-transcript-api verified working (v1.2.4 installed) -- instance fetch() method confirmed
- [Research]: Cloud Run "always allocated" flag name needs verification before Phase 7
- [Research]: All package versions from training data -- must verify against PyPI before writing requirements.txt
- [Phase 01]: Docker not installed on dev machine -- Dockerfile created but build/run verification deferred to Phase 7
