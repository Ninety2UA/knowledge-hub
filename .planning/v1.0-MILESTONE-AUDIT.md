# v1.0 Milestone Audit Report

**Milestone:** v1.0 — Knowledge Base Automation
**Audited:** 2026-02-20
**Status:** GAPS FOUND (25 unsatisfied requirements — phases 4-7 not started)

## Executive Summary

Phases 1-3 are **solid** — all 3 passed verification with full success criteria met, 108 tests passing, and clean cross-phase integration. The 16 requirements mapped to these phases (INGEST-01..08, EXTRACT-01..08) are all satisfied with evidence.

The milestone is incomplete because phases 4-7 (LLM Processing, Notion Output, Pipeline Integration, Cloud Run Deployment) have not been started. All 25 requirements mapped to those phases remain unsatisfied.

## Scores

| Dimension | Score | Details |
|-----------|-------|---------|
| Requirements | 16/41 (39%) | 16 satisfied (Phases 2-3), 25 unsatisfied (Phases 4-7) |
| Phases | 3/7 (43%) | Phases 1-3 complete, Phases 4-7 not started |
| Integration | 15/16 (94%) | 1 partial: INGEST-03 user_note handoff gap |
| E2E Flows | 2/2 (100%) | Health check + Slack→Extraction flow both work |

## Phase Verification Summary

| Phase | Status | Score | Tests | Key Finding |
|-------|--------|-------|-------|-------------|
| 1. Project Foundation | PASSED | 5/5 | 23 pass | Docker build deferred (no Docker on dev machine) |
| 2. Slack Ingress | PASSED | 5/5 | 61 pass (38 new) | All 8 INGEST requirements satisfied |
| 3. Content Extraction | PASSED | 5/5 | 108 pass (46 new) | All 8 EXTRACT requirements satisfied |
| 4. LLM Processing | NOT STARTED | — | — | 10 requirements pending |
| 5. Notion Output | NOT STARTED | — | — | 4 requirements pending |
| 6. Pipeline Integration | NOT STARTED | — | — | 4 requirements pending |
| 7. Cloud Run Deployment | NOT STARTED | — | — | 7 requirements pending |

### Orphaned Requirements

None. All 41 requirements in the traceability table are mapped to phases. The 25 unsatisfied requirements are properly assigned to phases 4-7 — they are pending, not orphaned.

## Cross-Phase Integration

### Wired Connections (15/16)

| From | To | Via | Status |
|------|----|-----|--------|
| Phase 1 → Phase 2 | SlackEvent model | `handlers.py` imports and instantiates | WIRED |
| Phase 1 → Phase 2 | get_settings/Settings | `handlers.py`, `verification.py` imports | WIRED |
| Phase 1 → Phase 2 | FastAPI app | `app.include_router(slack_router)` | WIRED |
| Phase 1 → Phase 3 | ContentType enum | Imported in router, article, youtube, pdf, timeout | WIRED |
| Phase 1 → Phase 3 | ExtractedContent model | Imported in article, youtube, pdf, timeout | WIRED |
| Phase 1 → Phase 3 | ExtractionStatus enum | Imported in all extraction modules | WIRED |
| Phase 2 → Phase 3 | extract_content() | `handlers.py:129` calls extraction public API | WIRED |

### Partial Connection (1/16)

**INGEST-03 user_note handoff gap:** `SlackEvent.user_note` is populated in `process_message_urls()` but the `SlackEvent` instance is discarded after `extract_content(url)` is called with only the URL string. When Phase 4 is built, it will need both `ExtractedContent` and provenance data (`user_note`, `channel_id`). The current code does not accumulate or return them together.

**Severity:** Non-critical — INGEST-03 is satisfied at ingress (user note IS captured). The gap is in forwarding, which is Phase 6 (Pipeline Integration) territory.

### Orphaned Phase 1 Exports (By Design)

These models are defined and exported but have no consumer in phases 1-3. All are intentionally reserved for phases 4-7:
- `KnowledgeEntry`, `NotionPage`, `KeyLearning` — Phase 4/5 consumers
- `Category`, `Priority`, `Status` enums — Phase 4 consumers
- `llm/` and `notion/` package stubs — Phase 4/5 implementations

## Tech Debt

### Phase 1: Project Foundation
- Docker build verification deferred — Docker not installed on dev machine (low risk, isolated to build layer)

### Phase 2: Slack Ingress
- "Phase 3+ will process each event..." placeholder comment in `handlers.py:106-107` (accurate documentation, not a stub)

### Phase 3: Content Extraction
- `ContentType` enum values `PODCAST`, `THREAD`, `LINKEDIN_POST` have no detection patterns in router — fall through to ARTICLE extractor silently

### Process
- All 6 SUMMARY.md files missing `requirements-completed` frontmatter field (prevents full 3-source cross-reference; VERIFICATION.md and REQUIREMENTS.md traceability were sufficient)

**Total:** 4 items across 3 phases + 1 process item
